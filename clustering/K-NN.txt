KNN - (K nearest neighbor).
Explanation : 
             It is a supervised learning algorithm also used in classification.
             Here we can do both classification and regression.
According to google :
             K-nearest neighbor algorithm is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression.
              
It is used to classify  non linear datapoints(we cannot draw a straight  line).


EXAMPLE :
         Suppose we have two categories,and in this category i have datapoint,and i need to classify it??how?
EXPLANATION :
         Now the first step is to select the k value(the datapoints to be selected which are near to the unknown datapoint).
         K value means how many near values nee to be selected in terms of distance,for finding distance between two points
         we have two methods :
         1)Euclidean distance
         2)Manhatten distance
         
Euclidean distance :
