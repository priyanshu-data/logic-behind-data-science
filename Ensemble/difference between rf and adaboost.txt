both comes under the family of ensemble learning.

        Random forest                                                            Ada boost
1)   is a bagging technique                                            1)  is a boosting technique
2)   is a parallel learning process                                    2)  sequential learning process
     meaning is                                                            meaning is
     individual decision tree or model are built                           it depends on previous model
     from the main data parallely.
     and none of the tree is dependent on other.
3)   here, individual model is a full grown tree.                      3)  here it is a stump.
