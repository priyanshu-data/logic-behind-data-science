This analysis aids in understanding the relation between two or more variables.      OR
A linear relationship is a statistical term used to describe a straight line(y=mx+c)(best fit line) or the relationship between a variable and a constant. Understanding two variables, one is independent variable and other variable is dependent variable.

what are the notation for y=mx+c
m=slope= whithin the unit change in the points(points in x axis). what is the change in best fit line(change in y axis),is called slope.
c=Where x and y points intercept

How it works?
How to know which line is the best fit line as one can have multiple fit line in x y plot.One can select best fit line with the least error values(distance from data points to the fit line) that line is called best fit line.
This line is also called the pattern that the machine has learned through training set.


In layman terms: i will have independent value and dependent value ,plot on the x and y axis.
Firstly , going with the training set, plotting the points on x and y axis. attain a best fit line there will be error values.(error values : suppose i have points 
     experience       income 
        2              40000 

But when i add best fit line it becomes                    experience     income
                                                              2           38000   
                                                              
This 2000 less is my error value.This 2000 is the difference actual my predicted.
To represent this error there are different matrices : like : 
1) sum of square error : squaring the errors and summing them up.(we square because some may be positive or some may be negative ,to overcome this negative part)
2)Root mean square error : taking root of above step and dividing them by number of records(here one should know which dataset records to be taken.Also called RMSE.
RMSE should be between 0 and 1
