Q) What is Clustering?
ANS) Clustering is a method of grouping objects in such a way that objects with similar features come together, and objects with dissimilar features go apart.
     It is a common technique for statistical data analysis for machine learning and data mining. Exploratory data analysis and generalization is also an area that uses 
     clustering.
     Clustering belongs to unsupervised data mining.  It is not a single specific algorithm, but it is a general method to solve a task.
     Therefore, it is possible to achieve clustering using various algorithms.
 
Q) What is Classification?
ANS) Classification is a categorization process that uses a training set of data to recognize, differentiate and understand objects. Classification is a supervised learning
     technique where a training set and correctly defined observations are available.
     
Q) What is the Difference Between Clustering and Classification?
ANS) Clustering is unsupervised learning while Classification is a supervised learning technique. It groups similar instances on the basis of features whereas 
     classification assign predefined tags to instances on the basis of features. Clustering split the dataset into subsets to group the instances with similar features.
     It does not use labelled data or a training set. On the other hand, categorize the new data according to the observations of the training set. The training set is labelled.

     The goal of clustering is to group a set of objects to find whether there is any relationship between them, whereas classification aims to find which class a new object 
     belongs to from the set of predefined classes.
