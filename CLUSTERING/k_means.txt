K-MEANS CLUSTERING : 
                     It is an unsupervised technique. 
                     K simply means centroid(center of the circle)
                     The K-means clustering is an algorithm which is used to cluster n objects based on attributes(features) into k partitions,   where k<n .  
                     or simply speaking k-means clustering is an algorithm to classify or to group based on the attributes/features into k number of groups.
                     K is positive integer number.
                     The grouping is done by minimizing the sum of squares of distances between data and the corresponding cluster centroid.
                     


For example : 
              k=3,and tested the model and i found that they are polluting the datapoints present in the clusters and i felt like increasing the value of k,i can increase the value of k.
              This is done by TRAIL and ERROR study.
              
              
  The steps involved are : 
                          1)how the algorithm works
                          2)which metrics(euclidean or the manhatten distance)
                          3)elbow method(selecting the right k value)
